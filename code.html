          <h1>Ibm call for code</h1>
          <h3>Competition - North America Finalists</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="containerInfo">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <h6>
            The IBM Call for Code is a yearly competition in which developers
            from all around the world gather to solve problems proposed by IBM.
            In the 2020 competition the area we decided to work with was Climate
            Change as team High Stakes.
          </h6>
          <h3>Motive</h3>
          <h6>
            With internship opportunities cancelled after the Covid19 pandemic
            stuck the world, I was left searching for opportunities to learn and
            grow my skills. This is when I was introduced to CFC by a friend who
            was organizing a team to compete and we quickly got to planning.
            competition not only brought a challenge for us to learn, but also a
            way to place our efforts for a good purpose. Since we are from
            Puerto Rico, we know first hand the devastation that a natural
            catastrophe such as a hurricane can bring and we wanted to be part
            of the solution.
          </h6>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            Designed and developed a ReactJS progressive web application (PWA)
            that shows weather conditions from the forecast as well as data from
            IoT devices deployed for disaster resilience. Used device GPS to
            collect location and consumed data from The Weather Company’s API to
            show the weather in the user’s current location. Compares the values
            received from the IoT devices and the forecast to warn or alert the
            end users in case of emergency. Developed Express backend to add
            push notification features with the browser’s service workers.

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <h6>
            Project Vanguard (previously UAV Search and Recue) is an
            undergraduate student research team focused on the design,
            development, and testing of autonomous drone solutions. I have been
            part of the team as Machine Learning Leader as well as with my
            current position of Chief Technology Officer (CTO).
          </h6>
          <h3>Motive</h3>
          <h6>
            These past years, Puerto Rico has lived through many catastrophes
            including hurricanes and earthquakes. With the amount of uncertainty
            on what could hit next, we are determined to research and apply new
            technologies in the creation of autonomous drones. We believe that
            drones are an incredibly powerful and dynamic tool to use for our
            well being.
          </h6>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            The team is undergoing the development of two projects called IRIS
            and ATLAS respectively. The IRIS project will utilize Deep Neural
            Networks to analyze the live feed from the drone on board and fly
            autonomously recompiling data such as people in danger. The ATLAS
            project is a collaboration project with the biology department in
            which we are attaching an SDR (software-defined-radio) receiver with
            an antenna fot the tracking and locating of animals in the wild.
            Python has been the primary language of the project. By utilizing
            Flask, OpenCV, TensorFlow and Keras inside of an NVidia TX2, we are
            able to receive realtime video input, perform object detection, and
            broadcast via network into a server with authentication to avoid
            unwanted attention.

        <div class="containerInfo">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <h6>
            Evertec is a Puertorrican Technology company with focus on
            electronic transactions. In 2018, they proposed a competition called
            Evertec Challenge for university students to develop a system to
            serve as point-of-sale for small businesses.
          </h6>
          <h3>Motive</h3>
          <h6>
            I decided to enter the competition as a way to push myself to learn
            and apply my programming and critical thinking skills. This became
            the first competition I entered which proved more difficult than
            initially thought.
          </h6>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            For the development, I chose the language I felt more comfortable
            with at the time which was Java. I created all the logic following
            an Object Oriented Approach, and used JavaFX to add the user
            interface. At the end I successfully presented a demo of the app and
            won the competition.

        <div class="containerInfo">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <h6>
            Using Python and OpenCV, I challenged myself to create a solver for
            any game of “Light’s Out” given an image of the board. Implemented a
            step-by-step solutions method to provide the user with easy to
            follow instructions.
          </h6>
          <h3>Motive</h3>
          <h6>
            Even though it started as a course assignment to write a python
            script that solves a "Light's Out" game board, the user always had
            to input the board as an array. Finding this process tedious, I took
            a crash course on computer vision with OpenCV and challenged myself
            to integrate the library with the python script to solve the board
            automatically.
          </h6>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            Python was the language chosen for this task, since using Numpy and
            OpenCV libraries provided many of the tools for this project. The
            program runs in the command line in which an argument parser was
            added to input the image of the board.

            Techstars travels the world giving 54hr workshops for entrepeneurs
            wanting to develop startups. On summer 2020, I participated in the
            SWPuertoRicoPRIDE event.
          </h6>
          <h3>Motive</h3>
          <h6>
            I've always been writing down creative ideas that solve different
            types of problems, but until this StartUp Weekend, I had never gone
            through the process of validating one. One of these ideas is named
            Contigo, an app that provides personal security to individuals
            walking alone in places where they don't feel safe by creating a
            community of first responders.
          </h6>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            For the design and wireframe of the application, I utilized AdobeXD,
            and allthough the implementation has not yet been done, I plan on
            utilizing web technologies. I am also in the process of choosing the
            best approach in terms of Native/Hybrid/PWA approaches based on the
            best performance and compatibility.

            I strongly believe that a website is an incredible tool to showcase

            create a website that represents me and my work in a minimal and
            unique way.
          </h6>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            Design and wireframing was completed in AdobeXD, while the
            development stack consisted of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Utilized
            frameworks such as Bootstrap to make the website responsive and
            leveraged on the open sourse javascript project BagguetteBox JS, for
            a clean view of the art section.
