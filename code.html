            I strongly believe that a website is an incredible tool to showcase
            your talents. With my knowledge of web development, I set out to
            create a website that represents me and my work in a minimal and
            unique way.

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            Design and wireframing was completed in AdobeXD, while the
            development stack consisted of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Utilized
            frameworks such as Bootstrap to make the website responsive and
            leveraged on the open sourse javascript project BagguetteBox JS, for
            a clean view of the art section.

        <div class="containerInfo">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <h6>
            Using Python and OpenCV, I challenged myself to create a solver for
            any game of “Light’s Out” given an image of the board. Implemented a
            step-by-step solutions method to provide the user with easy to
            follow instructions.
          </h6>
          <h3>Motive</h3>
          <h6>
            Even though it started as a course assignment to write a python
            script that solves a "Light's Out" game board, the user always had
            to input the board as an array. Finding this process tedious, I took
            a crash course on computer vision with OpenCV and challenged myself
            to integrate the library with the python script to solve the board
            automatically.
          </h6>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            Python was the language chosen for this task, since using Numpy and
            OpenCV libraries provided many of the tools for this project. The
            program runs in the command line in which an argument parser was
            added to input the image of the board.

          <h6>
            These past years, Puerto Rico has lived through many catastrophes
            including hurricanes and earthquakes. With the amount of uncertainty
            on what could hit next, we are determined to research and apply new
            technologies in the creation of an Electrical Vertical Takeoff
            Landing Aircraft capable of recompiling data in hopes of finding
            people in need of help.
          </h6>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <h6>
            Python has been the primary language of the project. By utilizing
            Flask, OpenCV, TensorFlow and Keras inside of an NVidia TX2, we are
            able to receive realtime video input, perform image segmentation and
            classification, and broadcast via network into a server with
            authentication to avoid unwanted attention.
